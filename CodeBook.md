#Code Book for Activity Data Taken from Wearable Technology
==============================

This is a codebook for the data in CleanActivity.txt.  

##Variables in final output CleanActivity.txt
* Activity : This notes the type of activity the participant that produced the data.
* ID : This is the volunteer ID.

The data collected for the original UC Irvine database came from the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn on the waist.  Jerk signals and the magnatude of the various signals were also recorded in the original dataset.  Much of the data was measured in 3-axial signals, and the axes were denoted by XYZ, representing the X, Y and Z directions.  You can read more about the collection of the raw data in the frequency_info.txt file in the UCIHAR_Dataset folder.


The UCIHAR_Dataset folder contains the original data readings and original calculations.  The following signals were measured for the original dataset (cut and pasted from features_info.txt):

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


These signals allowed UC Irvine to estimate the following set of variables (cut and pasted from features_info.txt): 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The resulting estimates are the quantities used to create the variabes in CleanActivity.txt.  In the process of cleaning the UC Ivine data, the average and standard deviation of each variable were calculated.  A complete list of the variables whos mean and standard deviation were calculated are below.


##Data: Raw Data from UC Irvine

The raw data can be found in the UCIHAR_Dataset folder.  More description about the data and the assignment are in the BackgroundInfo folder.
